# Weather Prediction

This is weather prediction project. Used to predict weather, specifically in Austin for Kalshi's bet weather.

Goals of this project:
- ML model to help predict specific weather in Austin giving weight to each models depending on their "accuracy."
- Turn this into a SaaS where people can get emails every day with the weather to "have better weather accuracy."

This is such a degen gambling project project, but yeah...
